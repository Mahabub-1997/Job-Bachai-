									<h3><span>Why Choose Us?</span></h3>
								</div>
								<p>Motivation is a very strong tool we can use to get further in life and to achieve our dreams and goals. Setting goals for ourselves is something that I consider to be very important, I believe in always pushing myself further and further in life, not only physically but mentally as well. We all have different things or tools we can use to motivate us towards our end goals. In order for us to stay motivated we have to have a goal and be driven towards achieving that goal. <br/><br/> For me, self-motivation is empowering. Finding something that I enjoy and love to do and setting the final goal of achieving it.

										  hen looking at job creation statistics, remember that not all jobs are created equal. Federal spending on public works creates construction jobs, which will successfully reduce the unemployment rate, but it may not stimulate as much demand as it would if the same number of better paying high-tech jobs were created.In fact, jobs created after the last few recessions have led to greater income inequality because rehired workers became willing to take jobs that paid less

										A University of Massachusetts at Amherst study found that all government spending is not created equal. The most cost-effective ones are building roads, bridges, and other public works. $1 billion spent on public works created 19,795 jobs. Public works create jobs because it puts people right to work. The federal government can quickly fund construction projects already in the approval pipeline. It can hire contractors, send money to the states, or hire workers directly. That was one reason why the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ended the Great Recession in 2009.It spent $85 billion in shovel-ready construction projects.

										  Tax cuts create jobs by letting families or businesses keep more of the money they earn. The idea is that consumers will buy more things, thereby stimulating demand. Businesses use tax cut money to hire much-needed workers. All tax cuts are not created equal when it comes to job creation, though. For example, a Congressional Budget Office study found that while the Bush tax cuts created 4,600 jobs for every $1 billion in foregone tax revenue, payroll tax cuts did betterâ€”they created 13,000 new jobs for every $1 billion spent.

										<div class="panel-body">
										   Another cost-effective solution is unemployment benefits. According to a 2010 study, unemployment benefits increased employment on average by 1.6 million jobs each quarter from mid-2008 through mid-2010.8 Unemployment benefits create so many jobs because the unemployed must spend all the benefits received, and they tend to buy necessities such as groceries, clothing, and housing right away. Retailers and manufacturers respond to the added demand by hiring more workers to keep up.These benefits also help keep the unemployed from becoming homeless. It is more difficult for them to find a job if they lose a steady address.
